## My process

Initially, I sorted out HTML tags and divs I was gonna use for my CSS. Then I positioned elements using flexbox and sterted styling them. 
In the end, I added media query for mobile screen and changed some styles to better view them on mobile screen. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries


### What I learned

I learned working with background image, flexbox, buttons,links, creating nice hovers, box-shadow etc.


### Continued development

In the process of coming to the solution I had to make changes several times, It turned out to be kind of hard. 
To make this process easier I intend to learn Git.
